      <p>People are the building blocks of neighbourhoods. The heart-beat of a
        neighbourhood is the interaction and cooperation between and among neighbours. We
        identified a gap in communication of activities taking place in neighbourhoods.
        This is as a result of a lack of meaningful connections therefore limiting prior notifications.
        Interactions depend on the existence of connections, networks and shared experiences.</p>
        <p>Lack of awareness of events such as public meetings and resident meetups
           breeds feelings of being disconnected and lonely. Word of mouth is unverifiable
         and posters litter the emvironment.</p>
         <p>Our solution therefore is <strong>Mtaa</strong>, a safe and credible
         online platform where members of a neighbourhood can sign up to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>View Community Events.</li>
          <li>Sned notification to members via email.</li>
          <li>Give feedback through suggestions and general enquiries.</li>
        </ul>
       <p><strong>Mtaa</strong> will help close this information gap thus help
       generate cooperation among neighbourhoods.</p>
