          <p>The heart-beat of a
            neighbourhood is the interaction and cooperation between and among neighbours.
            This can be achieved through shared experiences such events and public participation forums.</p>

          <p>We identified a gap in communication of activities taking place in neighbourhoods.
            This is as a result of a lack of meaningful connections therefore limiting prior notifications.
            Interactions depend on the existence of connections, networks and shared experiences.</p>
          <p>Lack of awareness of events such as public meetings and resident meetups
            breeds feelings of being disconnected and lonely. Word of mouth is unverifiable
            and posters litter the emvironment.</p>

          <p>Our solution therefore is <strong>Mtaa</strong>, a safe and credible
            online platform where members of a neighbourhood can sign up to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>View Community Events.</li>
            <li>Send notification to members via email.</li>
